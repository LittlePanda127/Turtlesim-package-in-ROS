turtlesim-package-in-ROS

We will walk you through the process of modifying the turtle package in ROS-noetic after installing and configuring ROS.

To begin, open a terminal. It's crucial to use the following command to launch the ROS master node:
```
roscore
```

I started up a second terminal. I'll give it another go at running Ros Master to see what happens. 







We already have nodes that you can start when we install ROS; you have standard nodes for instructional nodes and multiple nodes for various functions.
 1. In order to launch a node, we will use the command, which appears to be a program that prints "hello world" along with a date to the terminal.

```
rosrun rospy_tutorials talker
```

You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C to halt the node, but avoid doing so in order to avoid seeing an error or shortcoming.

Â 2-To see a graphical representation of the real ROS (nodes, topics, and connections that are operating on your computer), open a second terminal and enter this command.

```
rqt_graph
```

As you can see, there is just ONE node here, called "talker."

3-This is an additional application that will print something to the terminal and (hear) the timestamp along with "hello world." in fact, this info is coming from the node (talker)

As you can see, we have a token node here. Both a (talker) and a (listener) node are present here. The listener node receives some messages from the talker node.


Turtlesim 1: This command will display a turtle in a graphical window.
```
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

2. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, you can manipulate the turtle with this command.
```
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```
